### Hi, I'm Jordan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software engineer from Boston, MA. Earlier this year, I attended and graduated Launch Academy, an 18 week immersive coding bootcamp located in downtown Boston. Since graduating, I've been busy building exciting new side projects where I can learn new things and further implement skills I already h ave. I'm currently in the market for a new job, so if you're interested in talking, hit me up!
