### Hi, I'm Jordan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software engineer from Boston, MA. Earlier this year, I attended and graduated Launch Academy, an 18 week immersive coding bootcamp located in downtown Boston. Since graduating, I've been busy building exciting new side projects where I can learn new things and further implement skills I already have. I currently looking for a software engineering job and aiming to be the best version of myself! Hit me up if you have any questions!
